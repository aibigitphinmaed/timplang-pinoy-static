  <ul class="policy-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Information We Collect:</strong>
      We collect both personal and non-personal information when you interact with our website. Personal information may
      include your name, email address, and any messages or inquiries you send. Non-personal information includes your

      Your data helps us respond to your messages, tailor content, and improve site functionality. If you subscribe to
      our updates, we use your contact information to send occasional newsletters or announcements. We also analyze
      trends to see which content is most useful to our visitors. This ensures that we continue creating a better
      experience for you.

      <strong>Analytics and Third-Party Tools:</strong>
      We use tools like Google Analytics to understand how visitors use our site. These tools collect data such as page
      views, time on site, and referral sources. While they help us improve the site, they are managed by third-party
      companies that have their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review those policies if you have concerns.

    <li>
      <strong>Security Measures:</strong>
      We implement industry-standard measures like HTTPS encryption and server-side safeguards. While we do our best to
      protect your information, no online system is entirely immune from risks. We recommend using strong passwords and
      avoiding sharing sensitive data in public comments or forms. Your security is a shared responsibility.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Your Rights:</strong>
      You have the right to request access to the data we have about you. If any information is inaccurate or you wish
      to delete your data, you may reach out to us anytime. We aim to respect your rights in accordance with applicable
      data protection laws. Our team is committed to transparency and accountability.

      <strong>Children’s Privacy:</strong>
      We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and
      believe your child has submitted personal data to us, please contact us immediately. We will promptly remove any
      such information from our records. This site is designed for general audiences and not targeted at children.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Changes to This Policy:</strong>
      We may update this Privacy Policy as needed to reflect legal updates or website improvements. When we do, we’ll
      update the effective date at the top of the page. We encourage you to review this page periodically. Continued use
      of the site after changes means you accept the revised policy.
